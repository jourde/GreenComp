## 4. Competence areas and competences

### 4.1 Embodying sustainability values

The competence area 'Embodying sustainability values' encourages us to reflect on and challenge our own personal values and world-views in terms of unsustainability, and sustainability values and world-views. This area advocates equity and justice for current and future generations, while supporting the view that humans are a part of nature.

Socioecological problems are wicked problems, because they involve interlinked complex systems, such as the natural systems and the social systems including technological, political and economic systems. Our understanding of such complex problems lies, at least in part, in normative assumptions of the world, and in how we interpret social, political and ethical decisions.

Knowledge is often seen as value-free, which is based on the idea that it only stems from rigorous evidence-based processes that lead to objectivity, precision, acceptability and universality. Yet, our rationality is limited as our values and worldviews shape our perception and understanding of the world at all times, including our perception and understanding of sustainability problems. While descriptive knowledge explains reality through facts, normative knowledge on sustainability aims to identify how the world should look.

Sustainability competences such as systems thinking and futures literacy are useful when linked to sustainability values, as otherwise such competences could be used for unsustainable actions. By fostering sustainability values such as equity and justice for current and future generations and preservation and restoration of nature, learning for environmental sustainability can help shape a more sustainable future for communities and societies.

When learners are encouraged to reflect and question knowledge acquisition, assimilate it, and put it into practice, transformative learning takes place. Such learning involves cognitive (head), psychomotor (hands) and affective (heart) domains and encourages reflection, questioning and action. Transformative learning is learner-centred, therefore promoting student agency.

#### 4.1.1 Valuing sustainability

**Descriptor (1.1):** To reflect on personal values; identify and explain how values vary among people and over time, while critically evaluating how they align with sustainability values

Valuing sustainability aims to foster reflection on values and perspectives in relation to concerns for sustainability. In this context, learners can articulate their values and consider their alignment with sustainability as the common goal.

Valuing sustainability could be defined as a meta-competence, since its primary aim is not to teach specific values, but make learners realise that values are constructs and people can choose which values to prioritise in their lives.

Valuing sustainability enables learners to reflect on their way of thinking, their plans, and their actions. It asks them whether these cause any harm and are in line with sustainability values and thus contribute to sustainability. It offers learners an opportunity to discuss and reflect on values, their variety and culture-dependence.

**Examples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and attitudes (A):**

K: knows the main views on sustainability: anthropocentrism (human-centric), technocentrism (technological solutions to ecological problems) and ecocentrism (nature-centred), and how they influence assumptions and arguments;

S: can articulate and negotiate sustainability values, principles and objectives while recognizing different viewpoints; 

A: is prone to acting in line with values and principles for sustainability.

**For example:** Given the apparent tensions between sustainability and consumerism based on the use of natural resources, everybody should be able to contemplate what impact buying fast fashion or taking a flight for a weekend getaway would have at system level (SDG 12).

#### 4.1.2 Supporting fairness  

**Descriptor (1.2):** To support equity and justice for current and future generations and learn from previous generations for sustainability

Supporting fairness is about promoting equity and justice among present and future generations, while learning from past traditions and actions. Starting from the premise that human health is intrinsically linked to planetary health, this competence can help learners understand that environmental quality is linked to equity and justice. Access to green spaces can reduce health-related socio-economic inequalities. Environmental equity and justice imply, therefore, human equity and justice.

Yet supporting fairness is not only about promoting environmental justice and equity to improve human health. In line with the competence 'promoting nature', supporting fairness is also about taking into account the interests and capabilities of other species and environmental ecosystems, as well as the importance of preserving nature for future generations and for nature itself.

Supporting fairness as a competence can be fostered by promoting responsibility in collaborative activities and teamwork, while acknowledging and respecting other view points.

**Examples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and attitudes (A):**

K: knows that ethical concepts and justice for current and future generations are related to protecting nature;

S: can apply equity and justice for current and future generations as criteria for environmental preservation and the use of natural resources;

A: is committed to respecting the interests of future generations.

**For example:** The 'Stop Ecocide Foundation' initiative has been drafting a law on offences against the environment, or ecocide, which is defined as 'unlawful or wanton acts committed with knowledge that there is a substantial likelihood of severe and widespread or long-term damage to the environment being caused by those acts' (SDGs 14, 15, 16). Examples of ecocide include deforestation of the Amazon or the killing of protected species.

#### 4.1.3 Promoting nature

**Descriptor (1.3):** To acknowledge that humans are part of nature; and to respect the needs and rights of other species and of nature itself in order to restore and regenerate healthy and resilient ecosystems

Promoting nature is about developing empathy towards the planet and showing care for other species. This requires knowledge about the main parts of the natural environment (geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere and atmosphere) and the close links and interdependence between living organisms and non-living components. Knowledge about natural phenomena can spur us on to more closely connect with nature, which in turn can motivate further learning for sustainability.

Promoting nature fosters a healthy relationship with the natural environment and aims to ignite in people a feeling of connectedness that can help contrast the psychological distress and negative emotions that children and young people worldwide experience because of climate change and can help improve their mood and mental health.

The 'nature deficit disorder' conveys the human costs of alienation from nature: i) decreased use of the senses, ii) attention difficulties, iii) higher rates of physical and emotional illnesses, iv) a rising rate of myopia, v) increased child and adult obesity, and vi) increased vitamin D deficiency. Research indicates that to overcome the 'nature deficit disorder' not only do we need to be in contact with nature, but we also need to feel connected to nature. While the former involves physical interaction with the natural environment mainly at surface level, the latter concerns our feelings and views resulting from meaningful relationships being developed and the internalisation of our experiences in the natural environment, e.g. with animals, plants or places. Such internalisation can, in the long term, promote restoration of nature.

**Examples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and attitudes (A):**

K: knows that our wellbeing, health and security depend on the wellbeing of nature;

S: can assess own impact on nature and consider the protection of nature an essential task for every individual;

A: cares about a harmonious relationship existing between nature and humans.

**For example:** The Nature Conservancy – a global environmental non-profit organisation – believes that helping young people build relationships with nature (SDG 4) is critical to ensure a more sustainable future (SDGs 15, 3, 11). The Nature Lab, the Nature Conservancy's youth curriculum platform, provides educational resources for different age groups to teach them how nature works and how young people can contribute to its conservation.
