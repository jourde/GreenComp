## 4. Competence areas and competences

### 4.1 Embodying sustainability values

The competence area 'Embodying sustainability values' encourages us to reflect on and challenge our own personal values and world-views in terms of unsustainability, and sustainability values and world-views. This area advocates equity and justice for current and future generations, while supporting the view that humans are a part of nature.

Socioecological problems are wicked problems, because they involve interlinked complex systems, such as the natural systems and the social systems including technological, political and economic systems. Our understanding of such complex problems lies, at least in part, in normative assumptions of the world, and in how we interpret social, political and ethical decisions.

Knowledge is often seen as value-free, which is based on the idea that it only stems from rigorous evidence-based processes that lead to objectivity, precision, acceptability and universality. Yet, our rationality is limited as our values and worldviews shape our perception and understanding of the world at all times, including our perception and understanding of sustainability problems. While descriptive knowledge explains reality through facts, normative knowledge on sustainability aims to identify how the world should look.

Sustainability competences such as systems thinking and futures literacy are useful when linked to sustainability values, as otherwise such competences could be used for unsustainable actions. By fostering sustainability values such as equity and justice for current and future generations and preservation and restoration of nature, learning for environmental sustainability can help shape a more sustainable future for communities and societies.

When learners are encouraged to reflect and question knowledge acquisition, assimilate it, and put it into practice, transformative learning takes place. Such learning involves cognitive (head), psychomotor (hands) and affective (heart) domains and encourages reflection, questioning and action. Transformative learning is learner-centred, therefore promoting student agency.

#### 4.1.1 Valuing sustainability

**Descriptor (1.1):** To reflect on personal values; identify and explain how values vary among people and over time, while critically evaluating how they align with sustainability values

Valuing sustainability aims to foster reflection on values and perspectives in relation to concerns for sustainability. In this context, learners can articulate their values and consider their alignment with sustainability as the common goal.

Valuing sustainability could be defined as a meta-competence, since its primary aim is not to teach specific values, but make learners realise that values are constructs and people can choose which values to prioritise in their lives.

Valuing sustainability enables learners to reflect on their way of thinking, their plans, and their actions. It asks them whether these cause any harm and are in line with sustainability values and thus contribute to sustainability. It offers learners an opportunity to discuss and reflect on values, their variety and culture-dependence.

**Examples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and attitudes (A):**

**K:** knows the main views on sustainability: anthropocentrism (human-centric), technocentrism (technological solutions to ecological problems) and ecocentrism (nature-centred), and how they influence assumptions and arguments;

**S:** can articulate and negotiate sustainability values, principles and objectives while recognizing different viewpoints; 

**A:** is prone to acting in line with values and principles for sustainability.

**For example:** Given the apparent tensions between sustainability and consumerism based on the use of natural resources, everybody should be able to contemplate what impact buying fast fashion or taking a flight for a weekend getaway would have at system level (SDG 12).

#### 4.1.2 Supporting fairness  

**Descriptor (1.2):** To support equity and justice for current and future generations and learn from previous generations for sustainability

Supporting fairness is about promoting equity and justice among present and future generations, while learning from past traditions and actions. Starting from the premise that human health is intrinsically linked to planetary health, this competence can help learners understand that environmental quality is linked to equity and justice. Access to green spaces can reduce health-related socio-economic inequalities. Environmental equity and justice imply, therefore, human equity and justice.

Yet supporting fairness is not only about promoting environmental justice and equity to improve human health. In line with the competence 'promoting nature', supporting fairness is also about taking into account the interests and capabilities of other species and environmental ecosystems, as well as the importance of preserving nature for future generations and for nature itself.

Supporting fairness as a competence can be fostered by promoting responsibility in collaborative activities and teamwork, while acknowledging and respecting other view points.

**Examples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and attitudes (A):**

**K:** knows that ethical concepts and justice for current and future generations are related to protecting nature;

**S:** can apply equity and justice for current and future generations as criteria for environmental preservation and the use of natural resources;

**A:** is committed to respecting the interests of future generations.

**For example:** The 'Stop Ecocide Foundation' initiative has been drafting a law on offences against the environment, or ecocide, which is defined as 'unlawful or wanton acts committed with knowledge that there is a substantial likelihood of severe and widespread or long-term damage to the environment being caused by those acts' (SDGs 14, 15, 16). Examples of ecocide include deforestation of the Amazon or the killing of protected species.

#### 4.1.3 Promoting nature

**Descriptor (1.3):** To acknowledge that humans are part of nature; and to respect the needs and rights of other species and of nature itself in order to restore and regenerate healthy and resilient ecosystems

Promoting nature is about developing empathy towards the planet and showing care for other species. This requires knowledge about the main parts of the natural environment (geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere and atmosphere) and the close links and interdependence between living organisms and non-living components. Knowledge about natural phenomena can spur us on to more closely connect with nature, which in turn can motivate further learning for sustainability.

Promoting nature fosters a healthy relationship with the natural environment and aims to ignite in people a feeling of connectedness that can help contrast the psychological distress and negative emotions that children and young people worldwide experience because of climate change and can help improve their mood and mental health.

The 'nature deficit disorder' conveys the human costs of alienation from nature: i) decreased use of the senses, ii) attention difficulties, iii) higher rates of physical and emotional illnesses, iv) a rising rate of myopia, v) increased child and adult obesity, and vi) increased vitamin D deficiency. Research indicates that to overcome the 'nature deficit disorder' not only do we need to be in contact with nature, but we also need to feel connected to nature. While the former involves physical interaction with the natural environment mainly at surface level, the latter concerns our feelings and views resulting from meaningful relationships being developed and the internalisation of our experiences in the natural environment, e.g. with animals, plants or places. Such internalisation can, in the long term, promote restoration of nature.

**Examples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and attitudes (A):**

**K:** knows that our wellbeing, health and security depend on the wellbeing of nature;

**S:** can assess own impact on nature and consider the protection of nature an essential task for every individual;

**A:** cares about a harmonious relationship existing between nature and humans.

**For example:** The Nature Conservancy – a global environmental non-profit organisation – believes that helping young people build relationships with nature (SDG 4) is critical to ensure a more sustainable future (SDGs 15, 3, 11). The Nature Lab, the Nature Conservancy's youth curriculum platform, provides educational resources for different age groups to teach them how nature works and how young people can contribute to its conservation.

### 4.2 Embracing complexity in sustainability

The competence area 'Embracing complexity in sustainability' is about:

- empowering learners with systemic and critical thinking, and encouraging them to reflect on how to better assess information and challenge unsustainability;
- scanning systems by identifying interconnections and feedback; and  
- framing challenges as sustainability problems which helps us learn about the scale of a situation while identifying everyone involved.

Technological change, digitisation, and globalisation have increased our society's complexity and accelerated socioecological problems such as climate change and loss of biodiversity. Environmental challenges are interconnected and interlinked to economic activities and societal lifestyles. The operation of our economy, contained within our society, depends on our planet which has limited resources and boundaries.

Learning for environmental sustainability enables learners to be better equipped to see connections and links between specific issues and environmental change. Health is a fundamental human right, and access to a 'safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment' is also now recognised as a human right. However, minority groups and families with a lower income are often exposed to polluted environments, which in turns affects their health and wellbeing. Identifying the connections between environmental issues and income inequality, which may look unrelated at first superficially, can help us correctly frame such challenges as a sustainability problem and take preventive or mitigating actions.

#### 4.2.1 Systems thinking

**Descriptor (2.1):** To approach a sustainability problem from all sides; to consider time, space and context in order to understand how elements interact within and between systems

Equipping learners with systems thinking is necessary to understand complex sustainability problems and their evolution. Systems thinking allows us to understand reality in relation to other contexts (local, nation, global) and fields (environment, social, economic, cultural). It is critical for advancing sustainability. Thinking in systems enables learners to identify feedback mechanisms, intervention points and interactive trajectories. Systems thinking can be understood as a tool for evaluating options, decision-making and taking action. It is based on the assumption that parts of a system act differently when taken apart from the system. In fact, contrary to this, fragmentary thinking, i.e. analysing parts in isolation, instead of the whole interconnected system, increases short-termism and could led to an oversimplification of sustainability problems which may not correspond to reality.

**Examples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and attitudes (A):**

**K:** knows that every human action has environmental, social, cultural and economic impacts;

**S:** can describe sustainability as a holistic concept that includes environmental, economic, social, and cultural issues;

**A:** is concerned about the short- and long-term impacts of personal actions on others and the planet.

**For example:** Green technologies often promise positive outcomes for sustainability, yet they may have unintended consequences when scaled up to the system level (e.g. loss of biodiversity and increased competition for land due to biofuel production). Without a comprehensive understanding of complex problems and potential solutions, such consequences could be difficult to identify (multiple SDGs).

#### 4.2.2 Critical thinking

**Descriptor (2.2):** To assess information and arguments, identify assumptions, challenge the status quo, and reflect on how personal, social and cultural backgrounds influence thinking and conclusions

Critical thinking is considered fundamental for learners 'to cope with uncertainty, complexity, and change'. Critical thinking is a high-level cognitive process, which includes several skills needed for evaluating and understanding information regarding sustainability problems. This enables learners to broaden their views without taking information and information sources for granted. Eventually, learners should be comfortable when acquiring and integrating information from different disciplines. A critical outlook allows learners to challenge, and change, their values, perspectives and understanding of the world.

Critical thinking can help empower learners to become more responsible and actively cooperate in creating a sustainable world. More specifically, stepping up critical thinking will help them go beyond just passively understanding sustainability concepts. It will help them develop the ability to reflect and assess theories and assumptions.

**Examples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and attitudes (A):**

**K:** knows sustainability claims without robust evidence are often mere communication strategies, also known as greenwashing;

**S:** can analyse and assess arguments, ideas, actions and scenarios to determine whether they are in line with evidence and values in terms of sustainability;

**A:** trusts science even when lacking some of the knowledge required to fully understand scientific claims.

**For example:** A critical understanding of how fast fashion (SDG 12), poor labour conditions (SDGs 8, 10), solid waste accumulation (SDGs 11, 12) and pollution (multiple SDGs) are interrelated and underpin each other can help learners i) define the class of problems they need to deal with, ii) identify those involved, iii) adopt different perspectives, and iv) identify paths for possible solutions.

#### 4.2.3 Problem framing

**Descriptor (2.3):** To formulate current or potential challenges as a sustainability problem in terms of difficulty, people involved, time and geographical scope, in order to identify suitable approaches to anticipating and preventing problems, and to mitigating and adapting to already existing problems

Problem framing is the process of identifying actual or potential sustainability problems. It involves defining and structuring sustainability problems based on their complexity and those mainly involved. Understanding the nature of the actual or potential problems we are trying to define, e.g. from simple to wicked problems, can be a major obstacle.

Experts have identified four types of problems, based on how well defined both the problem and solution to address it are (see Figure 5). Differentiating between these four types of problem can help identify appropriate solutions.

This process also entails determining whether the current situation is already a problem or has the potential to become one in the future.

Most fundamentally, problem framing defines what is challenging about a given situation and identifies the best action to address it, which involves systems thinking. In essence, problem framing helps define goals and the direction the problem solving process should take. While sustainability problems are complex and often cannot be solved, appropriate steps can be taken either to anticipate and prevent them, or to mitigate and adapt them to an already existing problem.

Problem framing can help identify situations and frame them as current or potential problems for sustainability in a given context. This requires a critical understanding of socioecological systems. In turn, problem framing can help contextualise and define a sustainability problem in a given geographical and temporal context.

**Examples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and attitudes (A):**

**K:** knows that to identify fair and inclusive actions, it is necessary to look at sustainability problems from different stakeholder perspectives;

**S:** can establish a transdisciplinary approach to framing current and potential sustainability challenges;

**A:** listens actively and shows empathy when collaborating with others to frame current and potential sustainability challenges.

**For example:** The decline of bees and other pollinating insects can, for instance, be framed as a problem related to food production security requiring technical solutions in terms of agricultural management (SDG 12) as opposed to a problem with maintaining the renewal of nature threatened by the overuse of its resources (SDGs 15, 12).

### 4.3 Envisioning sustainable futures

The competence area 'Envisioning sustainability futures' enables learners to visualise alternative future scenarios and identify actions to achieve a sustainable future. It is essential that learners acquire the competence of 'adaptability' while coping with uncertainty about the futures and trade-offs in sustainability. Applying creative and transdisciplinary approaches to our way of thinking can foster a circular society and encourage learners to use their imagination when thinking about the future.

Learning for environmental sustainability encourages people to move away from looking for certainties but rather think about possibilities. It is fundamental that learners understand the future as open and something that can be shaped collectively. This requires the ability to analyse the present time and understand that it comprises complex systems interacting and influencing current and future trajectories, which in turn are influenced by our values, world-views and experiences.

Creativity, imagination and being aware of our emotions and intuitions can inform our ability to envision alternative futures. Learners are encouraged to use a combination of 'logical analysis and disciplined imagination'. Information from several disciplines and traditions has the potential to help people make more informed plans and decisions in a complex society. This can help learners identify steps and explore plans to collectively shape a resilient and regenerative planet.

Therefore, learners are advised to think of a wide range of possible future outcomes and envision alternative future scenarios for sustainability. By becoming comfortable with the notion of multiple futures, learners can acknowledge:

i. the uncertainty about the future as a given, rather than assuming or denying it;
ii. that it is impossible to know what will happen and thus the idea of trying to control what will happen will be rejected;
iii. that they need to identify probable, alternative, and preferred futures;
iv. that they need to influence and shape the trajectory towards a (collective) preferred future.

#### 4.3.1 Futures literacy

**Descriptor (3.1):** To envision alternative sustainable futures by imagining and developing alternative scenarios and identifying the steps needed to achieve a preferred sustainable future

Futures literacy empowers learners to create their visions for a sustainable future by providing them with the knowledge, skills and attitudes to understand the futures as a variety of alternatives. Research commonly differentiates between three approaches in order to understand the futures:

- expected future, i.e. what we expect to happen based on what it is happening today and what we know, e.g. business as usual;
- alternative future(s), i.e. what will happen may differ from expectations, e.g. creation of green jobs that currently do not exist;
- preferred future, i.e. we may envision a sustainable future for us, our community and our planet, and identify the steps and actions needed to achieve that future, e.g. a circular economy.

Through futures literacy, learners can anticipate, prepare and invent as changes occur. Futures literacy encourages learners to i) use their imagination when thinking about the future, ii) tap into their intuitions and creativity, and iii) assess the possible steps needed to achieve their preferred future. By using real-life experiences, learners can be taught in futures methodologies that adopt qualitative and/or quantitative research methods.

**Examples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and attitudes (A):**

**K:** knows the difference between expected, preferred and alternative futures for sustainability scenarios;

**S:** can envisage alternative futures for sustainability that are grounded in science, creativity and values for sustainability;

**A:** is aware that the projected consequences on self and community may influence preferences for certain scenarios above others.

**For example:** Prompting 'futures literacy' as a life skill for students and educators (SDG 4) is the mission of the global non-profit organisation Teach the Future. Thanks to their resources for lifelong learning, learners can imagine more sustainable futures, where, for example, communities have access to clean water, clean energy and healthy food (multiple SDGs including 6, 7, 2).

#### 4.3.2 Adaptability

**Descriptor (3.2):** To manage transitions and challenges in complex sustainability situations and make decisions related to the future in the face of uncertainty, ambiguity and risk

Adaptability is about being flexible and able to adapt to new situations and adjust in order to accommodate changes in our complex world. It is essential that learners be able to cope with uncertainty about the future and the ambiguity of wicked sustainability problems and how they may evolve. Adaptability should provide learners with the ability to cope with trade-offs in sustainability e.g. environmental impacts and social outcomes as well as economic aspects. Moreover, learners should feel empowered to consider options and make decisions even when facing contradictions and risks in terms of the future.

People can learn in order to acquire knowledge, which may result in them changing their opinions and behaviour, and learning to manage their emotions. For cognitive adaptability, this might involve better teaching people about the significance of a changing climate. For behavioural adaptability, this might involve promoting positive and constructive actions among young people that support and sustain the environment, such as saving energy, recycling, harnessing clean energy, controlling water use, and encouraging others at home and at school to do the same things.

**Examples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and attitudes (A):**

**K:** knows that human actions may have unpredictable, uncertain and complex consequences for the environment;

**S:** can take into account local circumstances when dealing with sustainability issues and opportunities;

**A:** is willing to discontinue unsustainable practices and try alternative solutions.

**For example:** Young people play a central role in driving the adaptation agenda. On 22 January 2021, young people from over 115 countries launched 'Adapt for our Future' a global youth call to action on adaptation. This initiative aims to prepare younger generations for the transition towards green and climate resilient development (SDG 13).

#### 4.3.3 Exploratory thinking

**Descriptor (3.3):** To adopt a relational way of thinking by exploring and linking different disciplines, using creativity and experimentation with novel ideas or methods

Exploratory thinking aims to foster creativity in order to envision alternative futures. By tapping into different disciplines, traditions and cultures in a transdisciplinary manner, exploratory thinking can help learners create future visions for a circular economy (SDG 12) and society (SDG 11). To move away from linear production and consumption patterns to circular ones, we need a combination of creative thinking and experimentation with new ideas and new approaches.

As innovations that help achieve a circular economy will change our society, they will also entail new ways of social interaction and new cultural practices. For example, online platforms for people to swap their clothes and share their cars, and avoid food waste.

Exploratory thinking therefore requires cognitive processes and for people to use their intuition. The issues covered and the pedagogical approaches taken in education on sustainability encourage learners to develop abilities in creative thinking, according to assertions emphasising the close links between the two.

**Examples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and attitudes (A):**

**K:** knows that sustainability problems must be tackled by combining different disciplines, knowledge cultures and divergent views to initiate systemic change;

**S:** can synthesise sustainability-related information and data from different disciplines;

**A:** is committed to considering sustainability challenges and opportunities from different angles.

**For example:** 'Reduce, reuse, recycle' is a well-known concept for the circular economy, and an exploratory thinking approach can help turn waste into a precious resource. The Eco-Schools programme has developed a number of trash hack ideas that can help explore the issue of waste from different perspectives (SDG 12).

### 4.4 Acting for sustainability

Acting for sustainability encourages learners to take action at individual and collective level to shape sustainable futures, to the extent possible. It also invites learners to demand action from those responsible to make change happen.

The last four decades have been warmer than any preceding one since 1850 and given the increase in human activities, this trend is unlikely to revert unless we take action to achieve systemic transformations.

Necessary transformations for sustainability are not only enabled by technological changes, but also by cultural and social changes, as well as behavioural shifts and institutional reforms. As such, a plethora of stakeholders at local level must be actively engaged to shape and achieve global transformations for a more sustainable planet. Individuals make everyday decisions, which have impacts and consequences for sustainability, whether they are, e.g. students, consumers, producers, employees, policymakers, or representatives of organisations or communities. Altogether, these individuals can work together to create new paradigms that can lead to global sustainability through their individual initiatives, engagement and collaboration at community or regional level, or through global partnerships to achieve the SDGs.

A sustainable planet cannot be achieved by small, one-off actions on their own; a consistent and long-term approach is required. For example, decisions on which type of mobility (SDG 11) we use or about what energy providers we use for our home and office buildings (SDG 7) will have an impact on the environment. In particular, circular products are made to last longer and be easier to repair by increasing their durability, reusability, upgradability and reparability (SDG 12).

Acting for sustainability should, however, include as its enabling counterpart the willingness of the decision-makers to share their capacity to make decisions, so that the activities of learners can have an actual impact.

Examples of action that people can take individually, within their communities include: voting for candidates who support the environment, volunteering, meeting local council members, launching capacity-building programmes and initiating collective action.

Learning for environmental sustainability can help us, as individuals, to identify steps, mechanisms, and actions and, as a reflective, determined and caring society, to reduce our impact on the environment (environmental footprint). Furthermore, it can help us increase our positive contributions to the environment. Learning for environmental sustainability can help equip all individuals with knowledge, skills and attitudes to think, plan, and take or request action for sustainability (SDG 4 target 4.7).

#### 4.4.1 Political agency

**Descriptor (4.1):** To navigate the political system, identify political responsibility and accountability for unsustainable behaviour, and demand effective policies for sustainability

Political agency is the capacity to positively influence the collective future, by mobilising those at political level to take action for change. Political agency requires the capacity to analyse the context, spot possible avenues to move the sustainability agenda forward, and identify key stakeholders that can be brought on board to help achieve sustainability.

Political agency can be focused towards advocating for a change in norms, rules, regulations, and institutional commitment for sustainability. However, it can also be directed towards the market and can push for green innovation or the promotion of lifestyle and behavioural changes. The green transition is one of the EU's top strategic priorities, and the role of governments in meeting the associated challenges has become increasingly important. Many Europeans demand action to tackle sustainability problems from those responsible for making and implementing policies, who are ultimately responsible for our future and that of future generations. When asked who is responsible for tackling climate change, Europeans from 17 Member States ranked national governments first, while those from five Member States ranked business and industry first, and those from the other five Member States ranked the EU itself first.

Political agency empowers learners to become agents of change and take part in a discussion that affects their futures. Furthermore, it shows learners that small actions can have widespread global repercussions and that by engaging others with ideas and activities that trigger reflection, everyone can contribute to political agency.

**Examples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and attitudes (A):**

**K:** knows policies that assign responsibility for environmental damage (e.g. 'polluter pays');

**S:** can identify relevant social, political and economic stakeholders in one's own community and region to address a sustainability problem;

**A:** demands political accountability for unsustainable behaviour.

**For example:** Grassroots examples of young people, who have been especially vocal in demanding political action by governments, include the Friday for Future movement and Extinction Rebellion (SDGs 13, 16).

#### 4.4.2 Collective action

**Descriptor (4.2):** To act for change in collaboration with others

Collective action as a competence stems from recognising that the role communities and civil society organisations play in achieving sustainability is fundamental. Collective action calls for coordination, collaboration and cooperation among peers. By acting together and working to achieve the same goal, people can find opportunities and meet challenges to contribute effectively to solving sustainability problems at the local level. Taken together, this will have an impact at the global level.

Collective action develops learners' 'ability and will to take part in democratic processes concerning man's use of and dependence on natural resources in a critical way'.

**Examples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and attitudes (A):**

**K:** knows how to work with diverse participants to create inclusive visions for a more sustainable future;

**S:** can create transparent, inclusive and community-driven processes;

**A:** is willing to engage with others to challenge the status quo.

**For example:** Collective action in the digital age has increased and is enabled through technology, e.g. the European Education for Climate Coalition, a digital platform that enables members of a community of practice to decide collectively, act collaboratively, and co-create solutions for sustainability (SDG 13).

#### 4.4.3 Individual initiative

**Descriptor (4.3):** To identify own potential for sustainability and to actively contribute to improving prospects for the community and the planet

Individual initiative relies on someone knowing what types of action are possible, having confidence in their own potential to influence change (internal locus of control), and being willing to act.

Recognising what types of action are possible and being aware of one's own potential in terms of sustainability problems are the first steps someone needs to take in order to seize the initiative as an individual. However, individual initiative does not only rely on opportunities for action and someone's self-awareness and self-efficacy. It also has a strong attitudinal aspect – the willingness to act.

Individual initiative nurtures the entrepreneurial mindset of individuals and empowers them take the initiative in their lives. By taking action in their personal sphere, individuals can act as agents of change and role models, inspiring their peers to try to achieve sustainability. This could also help debunk myths on behaviour related to sustainability, e.g. a sustainable lifestyle is more expensive than a non-sustainable one, and of a lower quality.

Furthermore, individual initiative encourages people to take preventive action when certain actions or inaction may have damaging consequences for human health and all life forms (precautionary principle). Rather than waiting for evidence in order to act, in case of uncertainty it may be advisable to act because it may be too harmful, or too late, to wait for evidence to emerge.

**Examples of knowledge (K), skills (S) and attitudes (A):**

**K:** knows that preventive action should be taken when certain actions or inaction may damage human health and all life forms (precautionary principle);

**S:** can act promptly, even in the face of uncertainty and unforeseen events, keeping in mind the precautionary principle;

**A:** is confident about anticipating and influencing sustainable changes.

**For example:** Courses, such as 'Knowledge to Action' as part of the International Master's programme in Environmental and Sustainability at Lund University, offer learners a hands-on opportunity to interact in real-world settings with those at societal level such as municipalities, organisations, companies and third sector organisations while taking part in a project that promotes sustainability (SDGs 16, 13).
