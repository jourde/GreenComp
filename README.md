By providing GreenComp content in Markdown format, we aim to make the framework:
- More accessible: Markdown is a simple, plain-text format that is easy to read and edit, even for those without technical expertise.
- More adaptable: Markdown can be easily converted into various formats (like HTML, PDF, or Word documents), allowing users to customise it for their specific needs.
- Easier to integrate: Educators and institutions can seamlessly incorporate parts of GreenComp into their existing educational materials and systems.
